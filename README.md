# quad_cone

Maya tool for making a quaded cone. Users can control the height and raidus of the cone, along with subdivision height, axis, and cap level. They can also adjust the apex of 
the cone, but doing so disables the subdivision controls to avoid bugs from occuring. There is also a reset button to return all values to default. 

My main goal with this project was to familiarize myself with the Maya API so I can build more useful tools in the future. I learned how to create primitives, how to manipulate them, and 
how to connect a UI for the user to control these manipulations.
